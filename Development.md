# Status #

Currently implemented in Perl. Stable.

# Roadmap / Future Development #

  * Implement in Python as that is the language that Impress!ve uses. This would be more desirable because:
    * It could be packaged with Impress!ve for Windows users as this package comes with Python included. This would alleviate Windows users having to install Perl.
    * makebeamerinfo could be then directly stitched into Impress!ve, simply becoming a more extensible viewer.
  * Barring the above occuring the roadmap for the version in Perl would be to write a GUI using perl-tk
    * Allow selection of available transitions in a list with tick-marks
    * Allow the opening of the .nav file and output file through dialogue box.
    * Perhaps allow editing after parsing for manual fine tuning of the .info graphically
