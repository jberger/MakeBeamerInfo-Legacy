# Version: 1.3.0
#
# Description: Perl script to take the .nav file from a LaTeX Beamer based presentation and create the .info file for
#              use with Impress!ve (http://impressive.sourceforge.net/).
#
#              Specifically it is intended to remove all intermediate pages from the overview and create a different 
#              transition for the new frame. It is set up to create a visually interesting but clean presentation without
#              any information of what is being displayed (i.e. no markers in the .tex file as gettransitions does). This
#              allows one to use a Beamer presentation that was not specifically created for Impress!ve.
#
# Requirements: - Perl for running the scripts (binaries will work without Perl)
#               - A presentation created in LaTeX-Beamer (http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/) - this script will not 
#                 work for any other presentation preparation scheme!
#               - Impress!ve for using the .info once you have it

############## makebeamerinfo (command line version) #####################

Description: Creates .info file for use with Impress!ve for
             presentations created with LaTeX Beamer.

Usage: makebeamerinfo base_filename [subfolder]

Options: Use optional subfolder argument if the .nav file resides in a
         subfolder of the base directory. This is useful if your compiler
         cleans up after compiling.

  For Example: To make a .info file for "document.pdf" whose
               document.nav file resides in subfolder "tmp" use command:
               $makebeamerinfo document tmp

         Other options can be set in the script itself under "User Options"

############## mbi-gui (graphical version) ###############################

Description: Creates .info file for use with Impress!ve for
             presentations created with LaTeX Beamer.

Useage: mbi-gui

The graphical interface contains two navigation sections one to find the .nav file and the other to find the .pdf file 
associated with it. Once the .nav has been specified it will look for the .pdf in the same directory as the .nav as well 
as the parent directory.

The interface also has selections for the default transition set. The first is "Default" which only specifies the 
overview:off for the frames and leaves the transitions unchanged. The second "Clean" --- which is the default setting 
for the makebeamerinfo suite --- uses "PageTurn" for frame transition and "WipeRight" for intraframe transition. The 
third setting is "Custom" which allows the selection of one frame transition and any number of intraframe transitions. If 
no intraframe transitions are selected, the transitions will be written as "None".
