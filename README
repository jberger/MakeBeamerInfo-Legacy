# Description: Perl script to take the .nav file from a LaTeX Beamer based presentation and create the .info file for
#              use with Impress!ve (http://impressive.sourceforge.net/).
#
#              Specifically it is intended to remove all intermediate pages from the overview and create a different 
#              transition for the new frame. It is set up to create a visually interesting but clean presentation without
#              any information of what is being displayed (i.e. no markers in the .tex file as gettransitions does). This
#              allows one to use a Beamer presentation that was not specifically created for Impress!ve.
