# Description: Perl script to take the .nav file from a LaTeX Beamer based presentation and create the .info file for
#              use with Impress!ve (http://impressive.sourceforge.net/).
#
#              Specifically it is intended to remove all intermediate pages from the overview and create a different 
#              transition for the new frame. It is set up to create a visually interesting but clean presentation without
#              any information of what is being displayed (i.e. no markers in the .tex file as gettransitions does). This
#              allows one to use a Beamer presentation that was not specifically created for Impress!ve.

Description: Creates .info file for use with Impress!ve for presentations created with LaTeX Beamer.

Usage: makebeamerinfo base_filename [subfolder]

Options: Use optional subfolder argument if the .nav file resides in a subfolder of the base directory. This is useful if your compiler cleans up after compiling.

For Example: To make a .info file for "document.pdf" whose document.nav file resides in subfolder "tmp" use command:
	$makebeamerinfo document tmp
